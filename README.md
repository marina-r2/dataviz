### Understanding the Relationship Between Healthcare Spending, Population, and Alzheimer’s Disease

In today’s world, Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most pressing healthcare challenges, particularly in aging populations. With its growing prevalence, understanding the factors influencing its occurrence and the resources required to address it is more critical than ever. This project explores the relationship between healthcare spending, population demographics, and the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease worldwide, providing valuable insights into this multifaceted issue.

#### Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis was to uncover trends and relationships between:
- **Healthcare spending**: The financial investment countries make in their healthcare systems.
- **Population**: The demographic characteristics, particularly aging populations.
- **Alzheimer’s disease prevalence**: The burden of the disease on healthcare systems and societies.

By understanding these relationships, we can identify patterns that could guide policymakers and healthcare organizations in better allocating resources and developing targeted interventions.

#### Data Sources

The analysis leveraged publicly available datasets on:
- **Alzheimer’s disease prevalence**: Data on diagnosed cases by country.
- **Healthcare spending**: Measured in terms of per capita and total expenditure.
- **Population demographics**: Information on total population, aging trends, and regional distributions.

The data was preprocessed, cleaned, and matched to ensure consistency, with special attention paid to resolving discrepancies in country naming conventions and regional groupings.

#### Key Insights

1. **Correlation Between Healthcare Spending and Alzheimer’s Prevalence**:
   - Countries with higher healthcare spending per capita tend to report higher Alzheimer’s prevalence. This may reflect better diagnostic capabilities and healthcare infrastructure.
   - Conversely, low-income countries may have underreported cases due to limited diagnostic facilities.

2. **Aging Populations Drive Alzheimer’s Prevalence**:
   - Aging populations are a significant driver of Alzheimer’s prevalence. Regions with a higher percentage of elderly individuals face a disproportionate burden of the disease.

3. **Healthcare Spending Disparities**:
   - While high-income countries allocate substantial resources to healthcare, low- and middle-income countries struggle with limited budgets, impacting their ability to manage Alzheimer’s effectively.

#### Methodology

The analysis was performed using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. Key steps included:

1. **Data Integration**:
   - Merging Alzheimer’s prevalence data with healthcare spending and population datasets.
   - Resolving mismatches in country names using fuzzy string matching techniques.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing trends and correlations between variables.
   - Identifying outliers and regional patterns.

3. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Highlighting actionable insights for policymakers.
   - Proposing areas for further research and investment.

#### Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations that bring the findings to life:
- **Scatterplots** showing the relationship between healthcare spending and Alzheimer’s prevalence.
- **Bar charts** comparing prevalence across regions.
- **Trend lines** illustrating the impact of aging populations.

These visualizations can be easily embedded in this blog to give readers an interactive experience.

#### Conclusion

This analysis underscores the critical interplay between healthcare spending, demographics, and Alzheimer’s prevalence. As populations continue to age, the global burden of Alzheimer’s disease is expected to rise, necessitating increased investments in healthcare infrastructure, diagnostic tools, and research.

By understanding these trends, we can take meaningful steps toward improving care and support for individuals affected by Alzheimer’s and their families.
